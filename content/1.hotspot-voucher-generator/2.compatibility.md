# Compatibility 

App was created in a modular way, so it can be integrated with any other system.

## HotSpot Backends

The app is compatible with following backends:

| Backend                                                        | Status        |    Android    |    iOS    |    Web App     |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|:-------------:|:---------:|:--------------:|
| [Ubiquiti UniFi](https://www.ui.com/wi-fi) (Direct Connection) | **Available** | **Available** | In Works  | _Incompatible_ |
| [Ubiquiti UniFi](https://www.ui.com/wi-fi) (Proxy Connection)  | _Planned_     |   _Planned_   | _Planned_ |   _Planned_    |

Due to a lack of CORS headers and cookie API authorization scheme in UniFi API, the web app is not compatible with UniFi Controller using direct connection.
To circumvent this issue, the app can be used with UniFi Controller using provided proxy server, which can be also used to hide controller login credentials from app end user.
